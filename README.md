*Note: This presently only supports Pokemon X and Y. Other games will be supported soon.

Adapted version of accrue's Python and json-based tracker.

Still work in progress, no major releases

Requires Python 3.10+ to run. Tested only on 3.11, however.


To use, run the citra-updater.py file via Python. Then, either direct your favorite browser (tested only on Firefox and Chrome) to http://localhost:8000/tracker.html or add a browser source in OBS directly. Citra must have a ROM open for the tracker to check for data.
